This is a list of tech books that I'm planning to read, or have read. I'll add more information on each book in time and I will hopefully write full fledged reviews for more books and link them from here. Feel free to comment on any book and recommend new ones!

Books to read
-------------

* {% rle "Sinatra: Up and Running" http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920019664.do %}
* {% rle "The Lean Startup" http://theleanstartup.com/ %}
* {% rle "The Art of the Start" http://www.guykawasaki.com/the-art-of-the-start/%}
* {% rle "Start Small, Stay Small" http://www.startupbook.net/ %}
* {% rle "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good" http://learnyouahaskell.com/ %} This book is advertised in the back of [Land of Lisp](#landoflisp) which I read in the [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/) book club. I picked it up because it seems to have a similar crazy style as [Land of Lisp](#landoflisp) which I enjoyed very much. Also some of the panelists on the [Ruby Rogues episode that discussed Land of Lisp](http://rubyrogues.com/043-rr-book-club-land-of-list-with-conrad-barski/) mentioned that they learnt Haskell, too. And to add to that I had tried to learn Haskell a few years ago and thought that now might be a good time to try again. I do hope that this time I'll be able to read the whole book :)
* {% rle "31 Days to Build a Better Blog" http://www.problogger.net/31dbbb-workbook/ %} This ebook on how to write a successful blog was mentioned on the [Ruby Freelancers](http://rubyfreelancers.com/) show and as I find it quite difficult to keep my blog going I hope that this will help me. After all as a freelancer I should have some kind of presence on the web ...
* {% rle "CoffeeScript: Accelerated JavaScript Development" http://pragprog.com/book/tbcoffee/coffeescript %} The CoffeeScript book by the Pragmatic Bookshelf. What more is there to say?
* {% rle "Eloquent Javascript" http://eloquentjavascript.net/ %} I think this book was mentioned on the [JavaScript Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com/) podcast. After reading a few chapters I'm not sure if that book is correct for me as I'm not a JavaScript newbie. But I think I should keep going as I'm sure I've forgotten quite a few basic things about JavaScript already.
* {% rle "Smooth CoffeeScript" http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/ %} An adaptation of [Eloquent JavaScript](#eloquentjavascript) for Coffee Script. And hey, it's free!
* {% rle "Metaprogramming Ruby" http://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby %} Even though I have been doing Ruby for a long, long time I still find some bits of the language difficult. And even though Rails is these days doing less "magic" I think it's still very important to understand these parts of the language.
* {% rle "The Agile Samurai" http://pragprog.com/book/jtrap/the-agile-samurai %} There was an episode on this book on the [Pragmatic Podcast](http://pragprog.com/podcasts/show/33). And as I work alone, and from home books like this help me improve my development technique (I hope).
* {% rle "Refactoring" http://martinfowler.com/books.html#refactoring %} What's there to say about this book? Probably on that it's surprising that I haven't read it, yet!
* {% rle "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning" http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning %} The brain is a surprising thing and does work in a different way than we think. Andy Hunt tries to help you understand how to more effectively use your brain in every day development.
* {% rle "Seven Databases in Seven Weeks" http://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks %} With all these new NoSQL databases that all use completely different ideas (graph databases, eventual consistency, ...) this I hopefully a great whirl-wind tour through the major ones to get an idea on what's out there.
* {% rle "Get Clients Now" http://www.getclientsnow.com/ %} The first book of the [Ruby Freelancers](http://rubyfreelancers.com/) book club. It was also highly recommended more than once by every panelist on that podcast. And as a freelancer I really should beef up my marketing skills.
* {% rle "tmux: Productive Mouse-Free Development" http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux %} tmux seems to be on everybodies mind these days. I've used screen a little back in the day but with everyobdy raving about it I think I should check it out.
* {% rle "Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests" http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/ %} Another book from the [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/) book club. And right on track with me learning more about TDD/BDD/refactoring/...
* {% rle "Refactoring Ruby Edition" http://martinfowler.com/books.html#refactoringRubyEd %} A specialized edition of [Refactoring](#refactoring) obviously for Ruby. As I do most of my work in that language I might check it out.
* {% rle "Bootstrapping Design" http://bootstrappingdesign.com/ %} As a web developer I don't have a real grasp on design. I can recognize a good design but that's about it. Hopefully this book will help me get at least slightly better at designing my own wesites.
* {% rle "Modular Front-End" http://modular-frontend.com/ %} We're modularizing and we're splitting up all our backend code, but the CSS and HTML is generally a mess. Roy suggests splitting up the HTML and CSS into modular building blocks that can be easily reused. I saw [his talk at Euruko 2012](http://roy.io/euruko) and again at [Rulu 2012](http://rulu.eu) and I can't wait for him expanding on his technique in book form.
* {%rle "The Productive Programmer" http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596519544.do %} Suggested by [Trevor Bramble](http://trevorbramble.com/)
