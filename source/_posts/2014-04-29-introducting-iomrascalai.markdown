or *"Help me learn Rust by pairing with me"*

After years working in interpreted languages (Ruby, JavaScript) I recently discovered [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). As I sadly don't have the opportunity to use Rust directly in a client project, I decided to come up with a toy project to help me learn the language.

As Rust is supposedly good for programs that actually need raw speed (unlike the web apps I generally write) I decided to come back to one of my old time favourites: an artificial intelligence for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">game of Go</a>.

I had already tried writing a few of those in recent years (including helping [Jason House with his bot written in D](https://github.com/ujh/housebot)), but every time I had the problem that working alone wasn't very motivating so I never managed to produce a working program.

To combat this I'm trying to pair program with people (i.e. *you*) to keep me going. So if you're interested in either learning Rust with me or writing an AI for the game of Go, [please get in touch](mailto:contact@urbanhafner.com)!

Currently (as of April 2014) the project is still in it's infancy (actually no code was written, yet), but please check out the [repository](https://github.com/ujh/iomrascalai) and [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/NU4MXbao/iomrascalai).

If you're new to Rust I suggest the [30-minute Introduction to Rust](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/intro.html), [The Rust Language Tutorial](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial.html), and [Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com/) as a start. If you're new to the game of Go ... well there's [a whole Wiki about it](http://senseis.xmp.net/)! And for computer go related content the best place is the [computer-go mailing list](http://dvandva.org/pipermail/computer-go/).

*So, please get in touch so that we can get this started!*
