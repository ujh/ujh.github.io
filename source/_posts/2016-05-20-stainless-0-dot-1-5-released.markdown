Today version 0.1.5 of the [stainless](https://github.com/reem/stainless) crate was released. It's been in the making for a while now. Mainly because the original author ([Jonathan Reem](https://github.com/reem)) has been busy with other things. But he graciously allowed me to help out as I like stainless as lot. So you can expect new releases more often from now on!

The highlights of this release are:

1. The ability to disable tests by using `ignore`.
1. Working benchmarks! They've been broken for a while now.
1. Matching on the error message for failing tests
1. Better documentation. The README was completely rewritten

Feel free to open [new issues on GitHub](https://github.com/reem/stainless/issues) if you think there's stuff missing from this crate.
