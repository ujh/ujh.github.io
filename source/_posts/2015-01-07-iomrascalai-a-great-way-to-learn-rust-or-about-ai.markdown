I wrote about [Iomrascálaí](https://github.com/ujh/iomrascalai), my
personal project to learn [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) by writing
an artificial intelligence for the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">game of Go</a>,
[on here before](/2014/04/29/introducting-iomrascalai/). Since then
it's gone rather quiet as I haven't had much time to work on it. We
bought a house and moved in, I got a new job, my wife started a new
job, it's winter so the kids get sick all the time ...

Now that things have *slightly* settled down I'm ready to continue
with this project. And this is why I'm writing this blog post. If
there's anyone out there who either wants to learn Rust or learn about
artificial intelligence then you're welcome to help out with this
project. I knew nothing about Rust when I started this project, but
that didn't stop [Thomas P](https://github.com/TisButMe) from joining
and essentially teaching me Rust. I'm very greatful and I'd like to
pay it forward by doing the same. So just have a look at the
[Github issue tracker](https://github.com/ujh/iomrascalai/issues), and
ask what do work on either in the
[chat](https://gitter.im/ujh/iomrascalai) or in the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iomrascalai).

And if you're interested in artificial intelligence then this could be
interesting for you, too. After all, the goal is to write a program
that is good a playing this game!
