For most of my professional life as a programmer I've been either working alone as a freelancer or in small teams that didn't practice pair programming. To improve my skills I want to start to pair program regularly with other people. If you're interested please contact me or just schedule a session on my [dedicated calendar](http://doodle.com/urbanhafner).

I'm open to almost any topic and programming language but I know Ruby and JavaScript (both in a web development context) best so that would be good starting point for me.

As I live in Grenoble, France we're probably going to pair program remotely. I don't have much experience in doing that so please bear with me being a bit slow and having technical difficulties :)
