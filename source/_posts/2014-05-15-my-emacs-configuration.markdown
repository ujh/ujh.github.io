As I currently work on a distributed team and we're trying to do more
and more pair programming I decided that it's time to give Emacs a try
again. Using [tmate](http://tmate.io/) in combination with either
Emacs or Vim seems to be the way to go due to the lower latency than a
proper screen sharing solution.

Right now my Emacs configuration is rather basic, but I think it could
be a good starting point for other people, too. This is why I made it
available as a [Github project](https://github.com/ujh/emacs.d).

If you have any problems with it let me know and more importantly (at
least for me personally) if you notice anything that I should do
differently I'd love to hear from you.
