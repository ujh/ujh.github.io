## Community

I started the Ruby User Group in Munich, Germany in 2007 and I'm currently in the process of starting the [Grenoble Ruby User Group](http://grenoblerb.fr).

## Open Source

### HouseBot

Worked on [HouseBot](http://sourceforge.net/projects/housebot/) which is an AI for the game of Go. Originally written in C++, but then rewritten in [D](http://www.digitalmars.com/d/). Also started an implementation of the game [Havannah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havannah) on top of the HouseBot engine, but never finished it.

### Small ruby projects

See [https://github.com/msales](https://github.com/msales) for a list of small projects or patches to existing Ruby projects that I authored during my time at [mSALES](http://www.msales.com).

## Education

### 2001 - 2007 Bioinformatics at [TUM](http://www.tum.de) and [LMU](http://www.lmu.de) in Munich, Germany

Finished with a German Diplom (equivalent to a Master). but Science wasn't the thing for me. We did however learn many data mining and machine learning techniques and I worked at a student assistant from 2002 - 2005 at [MIPS](http://mips.gsf.de) using Ruby, Python, C, SQL and specialized apps.

### 1992 - 2001 Christoph-Probst Gymnasium Gilching, Germany

Formal education according to the German school system. In the last year I started to teach myself C for the a mini thesis in biology (you have to do one those in the last year of school in Germany).

## Other

When I don't spend my time with my family (or anyone of us three is sick) I go out to take pictures with my [analog cameras](http://urbanhafnerphoto.com) (and develop the film at home). This is a nice change to spending the whole day in front of a screen.
