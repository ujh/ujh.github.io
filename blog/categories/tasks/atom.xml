 repository

<p>In
<a href="/2014/07/28/learning-rust-tasks-and-messages-part-1/">part 1 of this series</a>
we started implementing our Pi calculation using the Monte Carlo
method. We ended with code that works, but that still doesn&rsquo;t return a
value after exactly 10 seconds. In this part we&rsquo;ll finish the implementation.</p>

<p>The problem with the previous implementation was that the <code>worker()</code>
function had to wait for <code>montecarlopi()</code> to return, before it could
react to the message from <code>main()</code>. The solution to this should now be
obvious: Let&rsquo;s put the <code>montecarlopi()</code> calculation in a separate
task. Then <code>worker()</code> can listen to messages from both <code>main()</code> and
<code>montecarlopi()</code> at the same time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here&rsquo;s the code:</p>

<pre><code class="rust tasks-and-messages-3.rs">use std::io::Timer;
use std::rand::random;

fn montecarlopi(n: uint, sender: Sender&lt;uint&gt;) {
    println!("montecarlopi(): Starting calculation");
    let mut m = 0u;
    for _ in range(0u, n) {
        let x = random::&lt;f32&gt;();
        let y = random::&lt;f32&gt;();
        if (x*x + y*y) &lt; 1.0 {
            m = m + 1;
        }
    }
    println!("montecarlopi(): Calculation done");
    sender.send_opt(m);
}

fn worker(receive_from_main: Receiver&lt;uint&gt;, send_to_main: Sender&lt;f32&gt;) {
    let mut m = 0u;
    let n = 10_000_000;
    let mut i = 0;
    let (sender, receive_from_montecarlo) = channel();
    let initial_sender = sender.clone();
    spawn(proc() {
        montecarlopi(n, initial_sender);
    });
    let mut timer = Timer::new().unwrap();
    loop {
        if receive_from_main.try_recv().is_ok() {
            println!("worker(): Aborting calculation due to signal from main");
            break;
        }
        let montecarlopi_result = receive_from_montecarlo.try_recv();
        if montecarlopi_result.is_ok() {
            m = m + montecarlopi_result.unwrap();
            i = i + 1;
            let sender_clone = sender.clone();
            spawn(proc() {
                montecarlopi(n, sender_clone);
            });
        }
        timer.sleep(50);
    }
    let val = 4.0 * m.to_f32().unwrap()/(n*i).to_f32().unwrap();
    send_to_main.send(val);
}

fn main() {
    let mut timer = Timer::new().unwrap();
    let (send_from_worker_to_main, receive_from_worker) = channel();
    let (send_from_main_to_worker, receive_from_main)   = channel();
    println!("main(): start calculation and wait 10s");
    spawn(proc() {
        worker(receive_from_main, send_from_worker_to_main);
    });
    timer.sleep(10_000);
    println!("main(): Sending abort to worker");
    send_from_main_to_worker.send(0);
    println!("main(): pi = {}", receive_from_worker.recv());
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the output from running the program. As you can see from
lines 12-15 it&rsquo;s now working as intended. First <code>main()</code> sends the
signal, then <code>worker()</code> reacts immediately by sending the latest result to
<code>main()</code>, and <code>montecarlopi()</code> is left to finish its calculation (but
the result is discarded).</p>

<pre><code class="plain">$ ./tasks-and-messages-3
main(): start calculation and wait 10s
montecarlopi(): Starting calculation
montecarlopi(): Calculation done
montecarlopi(): Starting calculation
montecarlopi(): Calculation done
montecarlopi(): Starting calculation
montecarlopi(): Calculation done
montecarlopi(): Starting calculation
montecarlopi(): Calculation done
montecarlopi(): Starting calculation
main(): Sending abort to worker
worker(): Aborting calculation due to signal from main
main(): pi = 3.141339
montecarlopi(): Calculation done
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s go through the code and see what we had to change to make it
work. First let&rsquo;s look at <code>montecarlopi()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="rust">fn montecarlopi(n: uint, sender: Sender&lt;uint&gt;) {
    println!("montecarlopi(): Starting calculation");
    let mut m = 0u;
    for _ in range(0u, n) {
        let x = random::&lt;f32&gt;();
        let y = random::&lt;f32&gt;();
        if (x*x + y*y) &lt; 1.0 {
            m = m + 1;
        }
    }
    println!("montecarlopi(): Calculation done");
    sender.send_opt(m);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that it&rsquo;s in its own task it has to communicate with the
<code>worker()</code> function and send it the result of the calculation. This is
as easy as passing in a <code>Sender</code> when calling it. The only interesting
bit here is that we use <code>send_opt()</code> to send the result to the
<code>worker()</code> instead of <code>send()</code>. This is because <code>send()</code> aborts the
program when it can&rsquo;t send the message (i.e. the receiver is gone). We
need to handle this case as <code>worker()</code> may now return before
<code>montecarlopi()</code> is done.</p>

<p>So far so good. Now we need to have a look at <code>worker()</code>. It needs to
change to wire it up correctly with the new <code>montecarlopi()</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let (sender, receive_from_montecarlo) = channel();
let initial_sender = sender.clone();
spawn(proc() {
    montecarlopi(n, initial_sender);
});
let mut timer = Timer::new().unwrap();
loop {
    if receive_from_main.try_recv().is_ok() {
        println!("worker(): Aborting calculation due to signal from main");
        break;
    }
    let montecarlopi_result = receive_from_montecarlo.try_recv();
    if montecarlopi_result.is_ok() {
        m = m + montecarlopi_result.unwrap();
        i = i + 1;
        let sender_clone = sender.clone();
        spawn(proc() {
            montecarlopi(n, sender_clone);
        });
    }
    timer.sleep(50);
}
</code></pre>

<p>First we need a new channel to communicate between <code>worker()</code> and
<code>montecarlopi()</code>. Then we start the first calculation in a new task.
And after that we enter the endless loop. In it we check for both
signals from <code>main()</code> (lines 8-11) and from <code>montecarlopi()</code> (lines
12-20). If there&rsquo;s a message from <code>main()</code> it means we&rsquo;re done and we
exit the loop. If there&rsquo;s a message from <code>montecarlopi()</code> it means
that the calculation is done. We then update our best guess of Pi and
start another calculation.</p>

<p>The concept used here in <code>worker()</code> isn&rsquo;t that complex. What was the
most difficult for me to get right was the setup of the channel. You
can see here that we need to pass a copy of sender. This is due to the
fact that not only does <code>montecarlopi()</code>
<a href="http://rustbyexample.com/move.html">take ownership</a> of the sender,
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/tutorial.html#owned-closures">but also <code>proc()</code></a>.
This is designed so that Rust can safely move the <code>proc()</code> and all the
data associated with it to a different task. And we of course have to
have the channel defined outside of the loop so  that all tasks send
their data back to the same task.</p>

<p>And this is it for this post! In the next part we&rsquo;ll have a look at
how we can simplify this design. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but it took
me quite a while to get this design right. I can&rsquo;t imagine using it
like this in production code.</p>

    <id>http://bettong.net/2014/07/28/learning-rust-tasks-and-messages-part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The code examples of this blog post are available in the Git
 repository
 <a href="http://github.com/ujh/tasks-and-messages">tasks-and-messages</a>.</em></p>

<p>In the
<a href="/2014/07/24/learning-rust-compile-time-polymorphism/">previous learning rust blog post</a>
I promised to talk about runtime polymorphism next. Instead I&rsquo;m
starting what is probably going to become a multi part series about
concurrency. I&rsquo;m doing this as I just happen to need this stuff for
<a href="https://github.com/ujh/iomrascalai">Iomrascálaí</a>, my main Rust
project. Iomrascálaí is an AI for the game of Go. Go is a two player game, and
like Chess, it is played with a time limit during tournaments. So I
need a way to tell the AI to <em>search for the best move for the next N
seconds</em> and then return the result immediately.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Explaining how the AI works is out of the scope of this blog post. The
only thing you need to know here, is that it essentially is an endless
loop that does some computation and the longer it can run, the better
the result will be. Unfortunately each iteration of the loop is rather long, so
we need to make sure we can return a result <strong>while</strong> we&rsquo;re doing the
computation of that iteration. This is where concurrency comes in
handy. What if we could run the iteration in a separate Rust task?
Then we could just return the result of the previous iteration if
needed.</p>

<p>But enough theory, let&rsquo;s get going. As we can&rsquo;t just implement a whole
Go AI for this blog post we need to find a simpler problem that has
the property that it returns a better value the longer it runs. The
simplest I could think of is
<a href="http://mathfaculty.fullerton.edu/mathews/n2003/montecarlopimod.html">calculating the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method</a>.
Here&rsquo;s a simple implementation of it:</p>

<pre><code class="rust tasks-and-messages-1.rs">use std::rand::random;

fn montecarlopi(n: uint) -&gt; f32 {
    let mut m = 0u;
    for _ in range(0u, n) {
        let x = random::&lt;f32&gt;();
        let y = random::&lt;f32&gt;();
        if (x*x + y*y) &lt; 1.0 {
            m = m + 1;
        }
    }
    4.0 * m.to_f32().unwrap()/n.to_f32().unwrap()
}

fn main() {
    println!("For       1000 random drawings pi = {}", montecarlopi(1000));
    println!("For      10000 random drawings pi = {}", montecarlopi(10000));
    println!("For     100000 random drawings pi = {}", montecarlopi(100000));
    println!("For    1000000 random drawings pi = {}", montecarlopi(1000000));
    println!("For   10000000 random drawings pi = {}", montecarlopi(10000000));
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you run this you&rsquo;ll see that the value of pi calculated by this
function improves with the number of random drawings:</p>

<pre><code class="plain">uh@croissant:~/Personal/rust$ ./tasks-and-messages-1
For       1000 random drawings pi = 3.132
For      10000 random drawings pi = 3.1428
For     100000 random drawings pi = 3.14416
For    1000000 random drawings pi = 3.141072
For   10000000 random drawings pi = 3.141082
</code></pre>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s rewrite this program so that it runs for 10 seconds and
prints out the value of pi. To do this we&rsquo;ll run the simulation in
chunks of 10 million drawings (around 2.2s on my machine) in a separate
task and we&rsquo;ll let the main task wait for ten seconds. Once the 10
seconds are over we&rsquo;ll send a signal to the worker task and ask it to
return a result.</p>

<p>This is of course a bit contrived as we could just run the simulations
in sync and regularly check if 10 seconds have passed. But we&rsquo;re
trying to learn about task here, remember?</p>

<p>Creating a new task in Rust is as easy as calling <code>spawn(proc() { ... })</code> with some
code. This however only creates a new task, but there&rsquo;s no way to
communicate with this task. That&rsquo;s where channels come it. A channel
is a pair of objects. One end can send data (the sender) and the other
end (the receiver) can receive the data sent by the sender. Now let&rsquo;s
put it into action:</p>

<pre><code class="rust tasks-and-messages-2.rs">use std::io::Timer;
use std::rand::random;

fn montecarlopi(n: uint) -&gt; uint {
    let mut m = 0u;
    for _ in range(0u, n) {
        let x = random::&lt;f32&gt;();
        let y = random::&lt;f32&gt;();
        if (x*x + y*y) &lt; 1.0 {
            m = m + 1;
        }
    }
    m
}

fn worker(receiver: Receiver&lt;uint&gt;, sender: Sender&lt;f32&gt;) {
    let mut m = 0u;
    let n = 10_000_000;
    let mut i = 0;
    loop {
        if receiver.try_recv().is_ok() {
            println!("worker(): Aborting calculation due to signal from main");
            break;
        }
        println!("worker(): Starting calculation");
        m = m + montecarlopi(n);
        println!("worker(): Calculation done");
        i = i + 1;
    }
    let val = 4.0 * m.to_f32().unwrap()/(n*i).to_f32().unwrap();
    sender.send(val);
}

fn main() {
    let mut timer = Timer::new().unwrap();
    let (send_from_worker_to_main, receive_from_worker) = channel();
    let (send_from_main_to_worker, receive_from_main)   = channel();
    println!("main(): start calculation and wait 10s");
    spawn(proc() {
        worker(receive_from_main, send_from_worker_to_main);
    });
    timer.sleep(10_000);
    println!("main(): Sending abort to worker");
    send_from_main_to_worker.send(0);
    println!("main(): pi = {}", receive_from_worker.recv());
}
</code></pre>

<p>What we do is as follows: We open two channels. One channel is for the
<code>worker()</code> to send the value of pi to the <code>main()</code> function
(<code>send_from_worker_to_main</code> and <code>receive_from_worker</code>). And
another channel is to send a signal from <code>main()</code> to <code>worker()</code> to
tell it to stop the calculation and return the result
(<code>send_from_main_to_worker</code> and <code>receive_from_main</code>). To send
something along a channel you just call <code>send(VALUE)</code> and to receive
something you call <code>recv()</code>. It is important to note that <code>recv()</code> is
blocking and waits for the next value to arrive. To either run a
computation or abort we need to use the non-blocking version
(<code>try_recv()</code>) in <code>worker()</code>. <code>try_recv()</code> returns a <code>Result</code> which
can either be a wrapping of a real value (in this case <code>is_ok()</code>
returns true) or and error (in which case <code>is_ok()</code> returns false).</p>

<p>Running this produces the following output:</p>

<pre><code class="plain">uh@croissant:~/Personal/rust$ ./tasks-and-messages-2
main(): start calculation and wait 10s
worker(): Starting calculation
worker(): Calculation done
worker(): Starting calculation
worker(): Calculation done
worker(): Starting calculation
worker(): Calculation done
worker(): Starting calculation
worker(): Calculation done
worker(): Starting calculation
main(): Sending abort to worker
worker(): Calculation done
worker(): Aborting calculation due to signal from main
main(): pi = 3.141643
</code></pre>

<p>If you look closely at the result you will notice that we haven&rsquo;t yet
implemented everything as described. The <code>worker()</code> only returns a
result to <code>main()</code> once it has finished the current run of
<code>montecarlopi()</code>. But what I originally described was that it should
be possible to return a result <strong>while</strong> the the computation is still
running.</p>

<p>As this blog post has already gotten very long so we&rsquo;ll end it here
nevertheless. In the next installment, we&rsquo;ll finish implementing the
program and maybe even start cleaning up the code.</p>
